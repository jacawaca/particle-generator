# Particle Generator

Project for college course: Programming Languages, I did during the winter semester of 2019/20. The task was divided into two subtasks.

+ The first one was about simulating creation of particles due to particle collision (with specified parametr Centrality which dictate the number of created particles).
+ The second part of project was about computing some statistic parameters of collision.
